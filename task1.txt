Difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP2:-

HTTP1.1:-
1. It was created in 1997.It was the first standardised version.
2. It loads resources one after the other.And so if one resource cannot be loaded it blocks all other resources behind it.
   It is called head-of-line blocking (HOL blocking).
3. Transfer all the requests and responses in plain text message form.
4. We add a keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is an open connection between the server & client
   which keeps the connection even after the first request is done.It compress data by itself.
5. Response time is more.

----------------------Response time--------------------------------------------------------------
ClientRequest#1 ServerResponse#1 ClientRequest#2 ServerResponse#2 ClientRequest#3 ServerResponse#3



HTTP 2:-
1. It was created in 2015 in Google.It is much faster than HTTP1.1.
2. It uses single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
3. Transfer all the requests and responses in binary format.
4. HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. It compresses the header. 
   The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
5. Response time is less compared to HTTP1.1.

  ---------------------Response Time-------------------
  Client Request#1                     Server Response#1
     Client Request#2             Server Response#2
       Client Request#3              Server Response#3
